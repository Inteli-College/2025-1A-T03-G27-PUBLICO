The construction of the value proposition for the agricultural environmental monitoring solution stems from a deep understanding of the customer profile and operational needs in the field. Farmers, rural managers, cooperatives, and agribusiness companies constantly face challenges related to natural resource management, production predictability, and waste reduction. These users need to monitor environmental conditions such as soil humidity and temperature, nutrients, gases, and sun exposure to make more informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and crop management. The absence of real-time data and the high cost of traditional remote sensing solutions make this decision-making process difficult, compromising productivity and the efficient use of inputs.

In addition to the lack of accurate information, the target audience deals with network coverage problems, especially in remote regions where cell signal is weak or non-existent. IoT system maintenance in the field is also often difficult due to devices requiring constant power or having unfriendly interfaces. The solution‚Äôs value proposition seeks precisely to relieve these pain points while generating concrete gains in productivity, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness.

The solution combines an IoT sensing system with environmental sensors connected to ESP32 microcontrollers, transmitting data autonomously via wireless networks ‚Äî LoRaWAN in covered areas or 5G in urban or structured regions. The architecture is complemented by a scalable cloud infrastructure based on AWS services, such as IoT Core, Lambda, and PostgreSQL, allowing intelligent processing and storage of collected data. The analytical layer includes Data Science algorithms that transform data into agricultural forecasts, alerts, and strategic indicators for the producer.

From the user experience point of view, the proposal adds value by offering automated data collection, reducing the need for frequent trips to the field and lowering reliance on manual measurements. Intelligent analysis of this data supports better decision-making, improving accuracy in practices like irrigation and fertilization. Moreover, the system is designed to be accessible both financially and technically, being modular and scalable according to the size of the property.

Sustainability is also a core pillar of the proposal. The use of low-power sensors and solar energy contributes to reducing the energy footprint, while minimizing water and fertilizer waste supports more conscious agricultural practices. As a result, the solution not only improves productivity but also aligns farming operations with efficiency and environmental responsibility principles.

The full summary of the value proposition, including its main elements ‚Äî customer segment, pain points, expected gains, and solution differentials ‚Äî is presented in the tables at the end of this document.
