## **4. Wireless Communication: LoRaWAN and 5G**

The communication between sensors and the cloud can be done via **LoRaWAN** or **5G**, depending on the available coverage in the deployment area. As a **priority approach**, we will adopt the **most cost-effective solution**, avoiding individual 5G modules in ESP32 whenever possible.

### **4.1. LoRaWAN ‚Äì Direct Transmission to the Cloud (If Available)**
- **Gateway Requirement:** ‚ùå **No dedicated gateway needed** if LoRaWAN coverage is available from TIM or Vivo.
- **Range:** Up to **15 km** in open areas with an external antena.
- **Power Consumption:** **Very low**, ideal for battery-powered sensors.

üí° **Industrial Alternative:** Contact **TIM and Vivo** to evaluate **LoRaWAN coverage in agricultural areas**, avoiding the need for a **dedicated gateway** in the commercial version.

---

### **4.2. 5G ‚Äì Only if LoRaWAN is Unavailable**
If **LoRaWAN coverage is unavailable**, the **most cost-effective alternative** is using a **central 5G gateway**, which will collect data from ESP32 via **LoRa** and send it to the cloud via 5G.

- **ESP32 devices can use individual 5G modules**.
- **Also, a single 5G Gateway can be used**, reducing operational and hardware costs.

---

### **4.3. Private LoRaWAN Gateway**  
If **no public LoRaWAN coverage or 5G is available**, the solution will be the **deployment of a private LoRaWAN gateway**, allowing ESP32 devices to communicate via LoRa and forward data to the cloud via protocolo **Wi-Fi**.  

**Preferred Approach:**  
- **ESP32 devices will use LoRaWAN modules to communicate with a private gateway.**  
- **The gateway will be responsible for connecting the LoRaWAN network to the internet via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or 4G.**  

‚úÖ **This approach ensures that the system operates even without public LoRaWAN coverage or 5G.**

---

| **Scenario**  | **Transmission Method**  | **Gateway Required?** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **LoRaWAN coverage available** | ESP32 sends directly via LoRaWAN | ‚ùå **No gateway needed** |
| **No LoRaWAN, but 5G available** | ESP32 transmits to a **5G gateway** via LoRa | ‚úîÔ∏è **5G gateway required** |
| **No LoRaWAN or 5G coverage** | Gateway can use another connection (e.g., satellite) | ‚úîÔ∏è **Alternative gateway required** |

‚úÖ **The preferred approach will always be the most cost-effective, prioritizing the elimination of dedicated gateways whenever possible.**

---

## **5. Data Integration and Transmission**  

### **5.1. Sensor Integration with ESP32 (MVP)**  
The **ESP32** will be responsible for collecting sensor data and transmitting it via **LoRaWAN** (if coverage is available) or to a **dedicated gateway** (if 5G is used).  

üìå **Sensor Connection in the MVP:**  
- **RS485 Sensors (Modbus RTU)** ‚Üí RS485-TTL Adapter ‚Üí ESP32 UART.  
- **Analog Sensors** ‚Üí ADC Conversion ‚Üí Data formatting before transmission.  
- **Digital Sensors** ‚Üí Direct communication via I¬≤C or 1-Wire protocols.

## **6. Data Processing and Alert Generation**  

The **Agricultural Remote Monitoring (F-ARM)** system is designed to ensure **efficient data collection, secure storage, and intelligent analysis** of sensor-captured information.  

Data will be sent **at predefined standard intervals**, without the need for real-time monitoring. With the hibernation function, we will achieve a significant reduction in energy costs, something that will be better detailed throughout the project's development. The system will only **generate alerts for critical variations**, enabling farmers to make informed decisions.

---  

### **6.1. Data Upload and Cloud Storage**  

Communication between sensors and AWS will depend on the **available network infrastructure** at the installation site. We consider **three distinct scenarios**, each with a specific method of transmitting data to the cloud:  

---  

### **Scenario 1: LoRaWAN Coverage Available (No Gateway Needed)**  
If **LoRaWAN coverage** is available in the area (via public networks such as TIM, Vivo, or The Things Network), the ESP32 devices will **directly** transmit data to the LoRaWAN network, which will then forward the data to AWS.  

üìå **Transmission Flow:**  
1. **Sensors capture environmental data** (ESP32 + RS485 sensors).  
2. **ESP32 transmits via LoRaWAN directly to the public network.**  
3. **The LoRaWAN network forwards the data to AWS IoT Core** via the MQTT protocol.  
4. **AWS IoT Core processes and stores the data:**  
   - **AWS Lambda:** Initial data processing.  
   - **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL):** Stores historical records.  
   - **AWS S3:** Stores logs and backups.  

‚úÖ **Advantage:** **Eliminates the need for a dedicated gateway, reducing operational and maintenance costs.**  

‚ùå **Disadvantage:** Relies on **LoRaWAN coverage from the provider**, which may be limited in some rural areas.  

---  

### **Scenario 2: No LoRaWAN Coverage, but 5G Available (With 5G Gateway)**  
If **LoRaWAN coverage is unavailable**, but **5G coverage is available**, ESP32 devices will communicate **with a dedicated gateway** via **LoRa or Wi-Fi**, and this **gateway will have a 5G module** to send data to AWS.  

üìå **Transmission Flow:**  
1. **Sensors capture environmental data** (ESP32 + RS485 sensors).  
2. **ESP32 transmits via LoRa to a 5G Gateway** (local coverage of 1-3 km).  
3. **The 5G Gateway sends data directly to AWS via MQTT or HTTP.**  
4. **AWS IoT Core processes and stores the data:**  
   - **AWS Lambda:** Initial data processing.  
   - **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL):** Stores historical records.  
   - **AWS S3:** Stores logs and backups.  

‚úÖ **Advantage:** **Reduces the need for external LoRaWAN infrastructure**, as the private gateway handles communication.  

‚ùå **Disadvantage:** **Additional cost for the 5G gateway**, including data plans and power consumption.  

---  

### **Scenario 3: No LoRaWAN and No 5G Coverage (With Alternative Gateway)**  
If **neither LoRaWAN nor 5G coverage is available**, the system will rely on a **dedicated gateway** that can connect to the cloud via **Wi-Fi, satellite, or another available network**.  

üìå **Transmission Flow:**  
1. **Sensors capture environmental data** (ESP32 + RS485 sensors).  
2. **ESP32 transmits via LoRa to a LoRa Gateway** (local coverage of 1-3 km).  
3. **The Gateway transmits data to AWS via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or satellite.**  
4. **AWS IoT Core processes and stores the data:**  
   - **AWS Lambda:** Initial data processing.  
   - **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL):** Stores historical records.  
   - **AWS S3:** Stores logs and backups.  

‚úÖ **Advantage:** Can function in **remote areas without cellular network coverage**, as long as some alternative connectivity is available.  

‚ùå **Disadvantage:** **Higher operational costs**, as a satellite link or other alternative infrastructure may be required.  

---  

### **Summary of Communication Scenarios**  
| **Scenario** | **How ESP32 Devices Transmit Data?** | **Is a Gateway Required?** | **How Data Reaches AWS?** |  
|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|  
| **1. With LoRaWAN Coverage** | ESP32 ‚Üí Public LoRaWAN Network | ‚ùå No gateway needed | Via LoRaWAN network‚Äôs MQTT |  
| **2. No LoRaWAN, but 5G Available** | ESP32 ‚Üí 5G Gateway ‚Üí AWS | ‚úîÔ∏è Yes, 5G gateway required | Gateway sends via MQTT/HTTP |  
| **3. No LoRaWAN and No 5G** | ESP32 ‚Üí Alternative Gateway ‚Üí AWS | ‚úîÔ∏è Yes, gateway with Wi-Fi, satellite, or other network | Gateway sends via MQTT/HTTP |  

‚úÖ **The preferred approach will always be the most cost-effective, prioritizing the elimination of dedicated gateways whenever public LoRaWAN infrastructure is available.**  

---  

### **6.2. Alert Generation**  
Alerts will be generated **at predefined reading intervals**, based on the conditions detected by the sensors. Examples:  

- **Low Soil Moisture:** ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Soil moisture below recommended levels for the crop.‚Äù  
- **High Temperature:** ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Alert: Elevated temperature ‚Äì risk of heat stress on plants.‚Äù  
- **High UV Index:** ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è UV index above safe limits ‚Äì increased risk for crops.‚Äù  

üìå **The system WILL NOT operate in real-time** but will **issue alerts at scheduled reading times.**
